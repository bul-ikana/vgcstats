# ![](icon.png) VGCStats

A simple website to keep track of the stats posted in [@VGCStats](https://twitter.com/vgcstats) by [@ProfShroomish](https://twitter.com/profshroomish)

## How it works?

The site is hosted in github pages. It gets the data from a google spreadsheet using [Miso Dataset](https://github.com/misoproject/dataset). Images are borrowed from [Serebii](https://www.serebii.net/)
